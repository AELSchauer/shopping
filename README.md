## Practice with Passing Data with Sinatra

In this workshop, we're going to practice passing data between a client and a Sinatra server.

Remember, there are a few different ways to pass data. We'll be focus on passing data via query params (in the url) and via forms.

## Query String Parameters

#### Activity 1

You'll see a route defined in `shopping_app.rb` that handles requests to the root (`/`). It's looking for a "name" in the `params`. Can you add something to the url to make the name entered appear on the page? Do **NOT** change any code in the `index.erb` view.

If you're stuck, research query string parameters. If you're still stuck, scroll down to the bottom for help.

#### Activity 2

Next, create a route that handles `GET` requests to `/cart` that renders the `views/cart.erb` view template after setting the instance variables necessary. You'll need to pass query string parameters in your url with keys of `item_name` and `price`. Do **NOT** change the code in the `cart.erb` view template.

Again, if you're stuck - attempt to do some research on your own, then check the "Hints" section.

### Query String Parameters

#### Activity 1

After you launch you're server, type in `localhost:4567/?name=YourNameHere`. The `?` indicates that the data following will be query params. Then, we add key/value pairs using `=` and separate multiple pieces of data with `&`.

#### Activity 2

We need to first create a route to handle this request:

```ruby
# shopping_app.rb

get '/cart' do

end
```

Then, we'll need to assign the instance variables requested:

```ruby
# shopping_app.rb

get '/cart' do
  @item = params["item"]
  @price = params["price"]
end
```

The above params need to be passed in through the url like so: `localhost:4567/cart?item=Apple&price=4.50`

Then, we'll need to render the correct view:

```ruby
# shopping_app.rb

get '/cart' do
  @item = params["item"]
  @price = params["price"]

  erb :cart
end
```
